**- I like traveling a lot** 

The cities I visited are New York, LA, Portland, Vancouver, Busan, Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Okinawa. 
In this summer, I'll go to Berlin for studying abroad and travel in Europe. I want to visit London, Rome, Paris, and explore around Europe.

I listen to pop, K-pop, J-pop a lot. The first track of my spring playlist is "Wasurerarenaino" by sakanaction. 
I'm a big fan of NCT, which is a K-pop group with 26 members. 
My heavy rotation is "Space" by NCT 127. My bias is Winwin.
